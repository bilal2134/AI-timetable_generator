the development of a university timetable scheduling system designed to assign 
time slots, rooms, and professors to different course sections. The system aims to optimize room 
usage and professor assignments while adhering to a set of specified constraints. Utilizing a genetic 
algorithm, the system models the problem of timetable scheduling as a search through a space of 
potential solutions, optimizing towards the best possible timetable configuration. 

**Objectives **:
The primary objectives of the system are: 
 To ensure efficient use of university resources such as classrooms and professor availability. 
 To create a timetable that meets all educational and institutional requirements with minimal 
conflicts. 
 To provide a flexible and adaptable scheduling tool that can accommodate changes in course 
offerings, room availability, and professor schedules.
